1 allow only one module to be started at a time
2 reread module list after a new yast module was installed
3 switch language when the language module requests it (#15471)
4 split control center logo into three parts with the middle one stretchable
5 tell windowmanager that we don't support session management (#25204)

solution for 2,3: export an environment variable with pid, yast modules can
send us a signal then.
